			<h1>Average loan rate by occupation and income level</h1>
			<hr>
			<h3>Do pilots face sky-high levels of interest? Are bus drivers taken for a ride?</h3>
			<p>The following analysis allows you to find out. I took data from <a href='http://www.prosper.com' target='_blank'>Prosper</a>
			, which is a peer-to-peer lending site. This data was sourced from Udacity. It had data on 113,937 loans with
			81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status,
			borrower income, and many others. The data was last updated 03/11/2014. These loans are all unsecured loans.</p>
			<p>I decided to focus on occupation and income level. Please use the graph below to explore whether
			different occupations face different loan rates (APRs) even when they are in the same income bracket.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>How to interpret and use the graph</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I have calculated the average APR for each occupation and each income group</li>
				<li>Each occupation has a different APR profile</li>
				<li>To examine each, either run the animation, or select an occupation from the list on the right</li>
				<li>To see precise details for each occupation and income level, use the tool-tip</li>
				<li>The overall average for the entire group is shown in black</li>
				<li>For more details on the data preparation, see below the chart</li>

			<h4>Data source</h4>
			<p>This data was sourced from Udacity, but ultimately came from Prosper</p>
			<h4>Data preparation</h4>
			<p>I have focused on the APR and income groupings. I wrangled the data in R first, and amalgamated some occupations,
			reducing the total number of different occupations from 66 to 50.</p>
			<h4>Last update</h4>
			<p>The data was last updated on 03/11/2014</p>
			<h4>Contact details</h4>
